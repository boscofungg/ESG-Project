Dear Jessica,

Hope this email finds you excited and ready for new challenges! I'm reaching out to you from the organizing team behind TechAppetizup 2024, an event designed to nurture your innovative spirit and technological prowess.

As someone who's passionate about Fintech, Education tech, and Climate change tech (which are all areas of great interest at TechAppetizup), we believe this event will provide you with a unique opportunity to grow, learn, and connect with like-minded individuals. Our goal is to foster your dispositions in innovation and technology development.

Here's an overview of what we have planned:

*   **Mobilization Seminar**: Kickstart your journey on July 12th, 2024. This seminar will set the stage for the events that follow.
*   **Hackathon**: Join us from July 13-14 (and again on July 27-28) to dive into problem-solving and innovation with fellow participants.
*   **Greater Bay Area Tours**: A series of tours, running from August 2024 to January 2025. This is an excellent chance to explore new horizons and experiences.
*   **Hong Kong Regional Competition**: Don't miss the Hong Kong Regional Competition on March 25th, 2025. It's a highlight of our event calendar!

You can apply with your friends as a team of up to 5 members. We encourage collaboration and teamwork.

We believe that your unique perspective and skills would be a valuable addition to TechAppetizup 2024. If you're interested in participating, please don't hesitate to reach out. We'd be delighted to have you on board!

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,

Nelson,
