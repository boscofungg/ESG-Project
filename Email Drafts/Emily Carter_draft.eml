Dear Emily,

I hope this email finds you well. As someone who is passionate about innovation and technology, I think you might be interested in an exciting event that I'm organizing called Tech Appetizup 2024.

As the Founder and Managing Director of Appetizup, our mission is to foster youth's dispositions in innovation and technology development. We believe that the next generation of leaders should have a strong foundation in emerging technologies like Fintech, Edtech, and Climate Change tech. That's why we're hosting a series of events designed to nurture your creativity, problem-solving skills, and entrepreneurial spirit.

Here are some of the key highlights:

*   **Mobilization Seminar**: Join us on July 12th for an interactive seminar that will introduce you to the world of innovation and technology development.
*   **Hackathon**: Take part in our intense coding competition from July 13-14 (and also July 27-28) where you'll have the opportunity to showcase your skills and creativity.
*   **Greater Bay Area Tours**: Experience the vibrant tech ecosystem of Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area with guided tours scheduled from August 2024 to January 2025.

    You can apply as a team of 3-5 people, making it an ideal opportunity to collaborate with like-minded individuals and learn from each other's strengths.
*   **Hong Kong Regional Competition**: Don't miss out on the chance to compete at the regional level on March 25th, 2025.

Emily, I'd love for you to be a part of this exciting journey. As someone studying Social Science in Springfield University, your unique perspective and skills will undoubtedly contribute to the success of Tech Appetizup 2024.

If you're interested in learning more about this opportunity, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly. I'd be happy to answer any questions or provide further details.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Best regards,

Nelson
Founder and Managing Director, Appetizup
