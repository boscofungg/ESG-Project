Dear Sarah,

Hope this email finds you well! As someone who's passionate about innovation and technology development, I'd like to introduce you to an exciting opportunity that I believe will resonate with you.

I'm Nelson, Founder and Managing Director of Tech Appetizup 2024, a unique event designed specifically for youth interested in emerging technologies such as Fintech, Edtech, and Climate Change tech. Our mission is to foster youths' dispositions in innovation and technology development, and I think you might be just the right fit!

Here's what we have planned:

*   **Mobilization Seminar**: Kick off on July 12th, where you'll learn from industry experts about the latest trends and innovations.
*   **Hackathon**: Join a competitive coding event happening over two separate weekends (July 13-14 & July 27-28), where teams like yours will have the chance to showcase their problem-solving skills.
*   **Greater Bay Area Tours**: Embark on an enriching experience from August 2024 to January 2025, exploring cutting-edge tech hubs and meeting influential figures in your field of interest.
*   **Hong Kong Regional Competition**: Don't miss out on our culminating event taking place on March 25th, 2025, where you'll compete against the best in your region.

Our community values innovation, collaboration, and creativity. I encourage you to gather a team of like-minded individuals (max 3-5 members) from Riverside Community College and apply for Tech Appetizup 2024.

As someone studying Social Science at Riverside Community College and working in the Healthcare sector, your unique perspective will undoubtedly enrich our community!

If you have any questions or would like to learn more about this exciting opportunity, feel free to reply. I'm always here to chat.

Looking forward to welcoming you and Sarah Johnson to Tech Appetizup 2024!

Best regards,

Nelson

Founder & Managing Director
