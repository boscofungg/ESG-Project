Dear James,

Hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out on behalf of Tech Appetizup 2024, an exciting event that aims to nurture the next generation of innovators and technology leaders.

As a student at Hillcrest High School with a passion for Science and Technology, we believe you'd be an excellent fit for our community! Our event is designed to provide a platform for youths like you to explore cutting-edge technologies in Fintech, Education tech, and Climate change tech. We're confident that your skills and interests will make you a valuable contributor.

Here's what we have planned for Tech Appetizup 2024:

*   Mobilization Seminar (12 July 2024): Get ready to kick-start your innovation journey with expert guidance and insights from industry leaders.
*   Hackathon (13-14 & 27-28 July 2024): Join us for an intense coding competition where you'll collaborate with peers to develop innovative solutions.
*   Greater Bay Area Tours (August 2024 - January 2025): Embark on a journey through the Hong Kong and Mainland China tech ecosystem, gaining hands-on experience and networking opportunities.
*   Hong Kong Regional Competition (25 March 2025): Showcase your skills and compete against other talented youths for recognition and prizes.

We're inviting you to apply as part of a team with 3-5 members. This will be an excellent opportunity to collaborate with like-minded individuals, share ideas, and learn from each other's strengths.
